Python Mini Games Repository

Welcome to my Python Mini Games repository! This collection features three classic games implemented in Python using various libraries.

Games Included:

Pong
Snake
Slot Machine
Each game utilizes Python's standard libraries such as turtle and math, showcasing the integration of core programming concepts with graphical display using turtle for creating a separate game window.

Purpose:

These games were developed as fun beginner projects aimed at understanding:

Basic game mechanics and logic.
Interaction with graphical user interfaces using turtle.
Integration of mathematics and game rules using math.
How to Run:

To run any of these games locally, make sure you have Python installed on your machine. Clone this repository and execute each game file using Python. For example:

bash (terminal)
python pong.py
Ensure that you have the necessary libraries (turtle and math) installed. If not, you can install them using pip:
